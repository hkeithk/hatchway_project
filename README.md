This was a frontend coding challenge used to assess new developer skills. This assessment was done in less than a full work day and not in one coding session.

The assessment:
1. Fetch data from a public json api and present
2. Style the data using CSS
3. Add an input field and search through data for relevant information
4. Add a button and expandable/collapsible list view for each individual component
5. Create a tag input field that will allow you to add tags to the datasets
6. Add another input field that will allow you to search via tags

The design I used allows for searching via both names and tags. 

Technologies:
I did the challenge in react, javascript, html/css and axios. 
Decided to manage state internally instead of use redux/redux-saga as it felt like an overkill for a simple app like this. 
React hooks because the assessment recommended to use latest react technologies. 

Overall super fun little side assessment and some things I took away:
 - Better understanding of my knowledge of react/JS
 - Pinpoints my lack of understanding in certain areas, reinforced others
 - Good experience to try styling/ approachs that I haven't used in other projects for better breadth of knowledge. 
 - Should add unit tests in the future just for practice
