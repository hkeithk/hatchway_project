This was a frontend coding challenge used to assess new developer skills. This assessment was done in less than a full work day and not in one coding session.

Technologies:
I did the challenge in react, javascript, html/css and axios. 
Decided to manage state internally instead of use redux/redux-saga as it felt like an overkill for a simple app like this. 
React hooks because the assessment recommended to use latest react technologies.
